    "## About Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamic, interpreted language with a simple, straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without a lot of boilerplate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the [Python Tutorial](http://www.python.org/about):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy to learn\n",
    "* Efficient, high-level data structures\n",
    "* Simple, effective approach to object-oriented programming\n",
    "* Elegant syntax and dynamic typing, ideal for scripting\n",
    "* Extensive standard library\n",
    "* Easily extendible with new functions and data types in C/C++ (or other languages callable from C)\n",
    "* Extension language for customizable applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a static language, the source code does not declare the types of variables, parameters, and function return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Upside: Code is short and flexible, changes are quickly implemented\n",
    "* Downside: No compile-time checking\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** As of version 3.5 Python supports [type hinting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) which is a form of static type-checking. See [PEP 483](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0483) for a simplified introduction to type hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greeting(name: str) -> str:\n",
    "    return 'Hello ' + name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a very high level language (HLL). The emphasis is on **development time**, not **run time**. It's performance tends to be on par with other dynamic interpreted languages like [Lua](http://www.lua.org), [Perl](http://www.perl.org), and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en)."
